# A Productive Week (And A Half)

Hey everyone, Austin here.

I am not going to lie, I studied zero machine learning this week.

Instead, I have focused more on building the good habits that I want for myself this year. Taking care of the house, remembering to read, exercise, and working hard are all things that I want to be better at to improve my overall happiness and wellbeing.
This week I have done well with my goals, and I'm feeling good, and more importantly ENERGETIC. I have already beaten the whole "second Friday in January" thing when it comes to resolutions, and I aim to see this joint to the end. I am at 11 out of 14 days with meeting my activity goals, my first sprint planning with me in charge went well at work, and I am becoming indispensible. I even thought about how I want to write a book. What about? IDK. But NYT Bestselling Author Austin Phillips sounds nice. Maybe I will write a philosophy - computer science book like I like to read. How hard is it to publish your own book? Hard I'm guessing.

Jeg vil skrive en bok snart. That's the Norwegian phrase for the week. I always have to double-check what I put in here because I don't want to publish grammatical mistakes in any language, but 9/10 times I am correct. ;).

I think that's a good enough update.
