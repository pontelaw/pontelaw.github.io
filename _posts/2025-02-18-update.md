# Oops I Forgot

Forgot is a strong word. Let's go with "didn't have anything substantial to say so I kept my mouth closed". There, much more accurate.

These weeks, instead of working on Neurosynth, I worked on learning how neural networks work. I gained knowledge on structure, convolutions, activations, optimizations, and everything else as part of my Deep Learning class.
My business partner also started a new job so finding time is hard right now. That being said, my work has been slow and there are no excuses. Onwards and overwards and forwards. Wards.

Norwegian goes strong, and I have been teaching my 1 year old how to play chess. Nothing makes him happier than shouting "THE KING" every time I hold the piece up. He thinks knights are dogs. He will be better than me at 5 and better than his uncles at 7. Inevitable.
I did beat Jack in a blitz game the other day. The gap is closing.

That is all, as you were.
