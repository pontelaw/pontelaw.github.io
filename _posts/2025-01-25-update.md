# Neurosynth

At risk of it sounding like I am inventing an idea that my brother-in-law actually came up with, I will now present my (our) new project: Neurosynth.

The name might be a bit on-the-nose and is definitely being workshopped, but here's the gist: a camera, an emotion classifying machine learning model, and a synthesizer. Combined, you get a continuous feed, playing major and minor synth chords in accordance with the face you're currently making. The idea is so good that I hopped on board immediately.  Currently, we have a model, a camera program, and basic synths.

The biggest issue right now is model accuracy. With a current repetoire of 7 emotions to choose from, the model can only acheive mid 50s validation accuracy. This exercise will be good practice in tuning neural networks, and possibly building a production quality piece of software. Maybe we make an APP!

Or, in Norwegian, Kanskje vi lager en app! Kanskje vi lager ikke en app. Vi f√•r se i morgen.

Thanks for staying tuned.
